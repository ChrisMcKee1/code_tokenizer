# Codebase2Markdown Updates

- Updated all Claude 3 models (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku) to have 200K token context windows for accurate token counting and file size estimation.
- Updated OpenAI model context windows: o1 and o3-mini to 200K tokens, others remain at 128K tokens.
- Updated Gemini models: Added Gemini 2.0 Flash (1M tokens), Flash Lite Preview (1M tokens), and 1.5 Pro (2M tokens).
- Changed default model to o3-mini (200K tokens) for all token counting and truncation operations.
- Optimized markdown output format to reduce token usage while maintaining all context (inline metadata, reduced whitespace).
- Added robust error handling and self-healing for problematic files (multiple encodings, binary detection, character cleanup).
- Added support for custom gitignore file path with new --gitignore option, allowing users to specify alternative .gitignore locations.
- Updated the repository fork link in README.md to point to the correct GitHub repository.
- Fixed the broken "Report Bug" link in README.md to correctly point to the issues page.
- Added comprehensive test scenarios for Python, Java, and C# applications, covering basic tokenization, empty input, special characters, comments, large files, and encoding handling.
- Created new test project structures using CLI tools for C#, Python, and Java, including proper .gitignore files and testing frameworks.
